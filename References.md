There is a tone of research and different projects that have worked on the topic of C2 over side channels. A lot of the work begain with simply being concerned that data could be snooped out of the air but now has evolved to the understanding that those same emanations can be used to transmit data out intentionally.

Below is a list of references I found helpful in research and development of my project.
